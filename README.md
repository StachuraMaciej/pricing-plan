## Pricing plan 

Payment plans refer to a method of paying for a product or service in installments over a period of time, rather than paying for it all at once.
Plans typically involve an initial down payment or deposit, followed by regular payments made over a specified period of time. The frequency of payments and the total number of payments required will vary depending on the specific payment plan offered.
